## Project Description
Write a short description of your project. Write 1-2 sentences about what what you chose to build and why.
Game = Blackjack

Basic Rules/ Assumptions:
1. There are two players: you as player, the computer as dealer.
2. Each card is worth their value, face cards are worth 10, the ace is worth 1 or 11 (player will be asked)
3. The person who has a sum of 21 or the maximum sum value under 21 wins. The player who has over 21 looses automatically. 
4. The player will be asked if he wants to draw another card as long as he is under 21
5. The dealer can only add a card to the deck if his sum is under 17. 

#### Extra: 

- Enter a starting amount of money to turn to chips
- Enter value of bet on game round
- Play only as long as you have money in chips

## Workflow
Outline the workflow you used in your project. What were the steps you went through?
1. Define rules and assumptions.
2. Write down basic game flow - expected variables + funcitons to program
3. Define game function. 
4. Work on sub- functions of variables defined in game function. 
    - Player and dealer hand
    - Sum of hands
    - Hit or stand choice
    - Solution 
    - Continue playing?
5. Check if funcitons all get called correctly and revise code
6. Work on extra mile code - While loop
    - add variables: player_value, game_bet
    - while player_value > 0 - continue

- pycharm for coding during no internet + checking code errors
- stack overflow for questions and error resolving
